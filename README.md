# AsteroidsNEO
Prepare for a new spin on an old classic: AsteroidsNEO is here to fill your rock-destroying urge!

# Features
## Gamemodes
### Endless
What you're used to! An endless barrage of asteroids to blast into bits (and points!).

### Invasion (Coming soon...)
Saucers galore. They fight back, and they're sharp shooters. Watch out for flying cows.

## Game Types
### Classic
The classic Asteroids experience, in HD! Accurate movement, hitboxes, point values, spawn rates, enemy behavior, and more.
